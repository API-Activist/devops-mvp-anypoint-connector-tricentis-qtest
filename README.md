Now you are all set to use the Tricentis qTest Operations.

## Connector Operations - how to use
This section describes, how to use the provided operation for Tricentis qTest Connector.

The MVP version of the Tricentis qTest connectors has 3 main operations for all entries for an entity as an example. 
- **Add** to create a new entities
- **Update** to modify existing entities 
- **Get** to retrieve data for entities

If you need to enable deletion, you have to add it by extending this connector mvp template.

### Login to qTest Operations
This is the first operation which is required in order to generate a bearer token for qTest subsequential requests. 

### Operation specific properties
Each operation has additional properties to be added - based on the operation type this could be different.

Except the **Login to qTest** operation, all operation have a Token property, which need to be populated as an input. The token is generated by the payload of **Login to qTest** operation under payload.access_token. Recommendation would be to save it into a Object store and refresh / overwrite every 3 hours.

Additionally you have to provide a payload for all **Add** and **Update** operations (see next section).

### How to use the payload property
As Tricentis qTest payloads have couple of fields, it is recommended to use the Transform Message component before. 


When using a transform message component, make use of the example payloads provided for **new** and **update** operations [provided here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/core/teams/create?view=azure-devops-rest-6.1).


### Reponse of operations
By default it is a json sent back as string. Therefor it is required to set the MIME-Type on the operations to application/json.

## Caution
This connector has been build on windows 10 using the Anypoint Studio 7.10 IDE. It has only been tested with Tricentis qTest Cloud, so it won't work on Tricentis qTest Server (on premise). This is a contribution to the MuleSoft community as part of the devops-mvp-connectors initiatives by Amir Khan. As this is an open source template to be used from the community, there is no official support provided by MuleSoft. Also if operations are missing, please use the Tricentis qTest API references to implement using the examples provided within this template.
